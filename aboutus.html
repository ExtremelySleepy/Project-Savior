    <p id="text">As humans that live on the planet earth, the environment we inhabit is a prevalent aspect of our everyday life. Every day, society is constantly shifting from one place to another and in between these commutes, mass amounts of pollution and waste submerge within depths of nature and almost little to no plant life. It is up to us as the people to-.

    Here is where every recycling and anti-pollution website  would then state the cliche of how all humans are extremely awful and how we are always constantly littering in our lives and that we must stop. The truth is, blatantly saying, no amount of gum wrappers or soda cans that are thrown out onto the streets could even come close to the amount big corporations contaminate our earth. It’s not just stinky roads or trash cans overflowing anymore. It’s our atmosphere, our oceans, and our wildlife, all in the hands of wealthy corporate owners who only have one goal in mind. Money. 
    
    You could in fact continue and do absolutely nothing as you are only one in seven billion people on this planet, but that being said, you’ll be part of the seven billion living on one that is suffering for not only us but for the future generation. Do your part and check out more on this website for more details where petitions, exposing large companies, and more are located at.
